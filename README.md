# Citi_Bike
## Project
In this module, you’ll work with data visualization software called Tableau to present a business proposal for a bike-sharing company. First, you’ll learn how to import, style, and portray data accurately. Then, you’ll create worksheets, dashboards, and stories to visualize key data from a New York Citi Bike dataset. 

## Resources  
In this project, we used data from the Citi Bike program in New York City. The data we downloaded was contained in a flat file, a CSV. 
We went to the [Citi Bike System Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) page. We navigated to the list to **201908-citibike-tripdata.csv.zip**, then downloaded and saved on our computer.
